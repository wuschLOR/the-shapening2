# the-shapening 2

Code to the second experiment of my diploma thesis.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## WHAT DOES THIS THING DO ?

 The script is presenting the [stimulus](./input/stimulus) eihter in a central or one of the four corners of the screen. This is to invoke different reaction times because the stimulus is processed either in foveal or onvoveal vision. Also I hope to get some insight to the way persons percieve different cinds of shapes.
